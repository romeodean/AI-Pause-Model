# AI-Pause-Model

### Overview
This model simulates an AI pause scenario where the US and China form a coalition to significantly slow down AI software development and hardware production. The goal is to model when rogue actors and black sites will catch up to the coalition's AI capabilities.

STATUS: WIP model that i'm implementing in 3 phases

## PHASE 1 - Generate actors and starting conditions
STATUS: In progress

> RUN INSTRUCTIONS: python run_phase1.py

#### PHASE 1 SUMMARY

Actor Generation
Phase 1 generates all actors in the simulation with realistic hardware and software characteristics based on the starting conditions in March 2027 (the "deal point").


PHASE 2 - Model transition dynamics through 2042
STATUS: Not started

PHASE 3 - Refine parameters and run 10000+ simulations
STATUS: Not started
